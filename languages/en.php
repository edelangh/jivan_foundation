and self-development.
In 1995 Jivan created the Sangita Vidya Mandir Education Centre in the slums of New Delhi and Rishikesh. The
school today comprises 12 classes from nursery to the high school, with subjects dispensed in English, Hindi
and Urdu.
We not only provide education but also to accompany the children in their development, trying to bring back
smiles to their faces and confidence to their hearts.
Itâ€™s a journey that we do together with the children, their parents when they are there and the team of the
education center since 23 years.",
