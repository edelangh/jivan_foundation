For example last month Elodie, an active member since several years from Marseille, organised an event inviting her friends, colleagues and family for an afternoon event that included a sale of Indian handicrafts, a small food stall and a short video presentation of the association.

It was just 45 years ago that Sophie Rombaut as a young medical professional arrived in India after being invited by her professor. Deeply touched by the need when she entered in the slum of Shadipur Depot in Delhi she immediately decided that she had to do something to help. The Shadipur depot slum was organised in 2 parts one side as “the healthy” as it was called, and the other part inhabited by the leprosy patients. 
</br></br>
She started with some Indian friends a small class for children under black tarpaulin sheet. She was deeply convinced that by educating a child you can educate a generation to follow. But she soon realised that the children from the other part of the slum would not be allowed to join as their parents were leprosy. As for her a child is a child and he has not asked to be born to leprosy patients, in a slum or in a low cast, it was extremely unfair to not give them equal rights. But in India leprosy even if not transmitted by heredity, it remained a big taboo. 
</br></br>
Hence, she decided to open a second school in the leprosy side. It is there that she realised a severe need for medical assistance especially as no doctor would ever go to a leprosy colony and even less for women who would not show to a male doctor. Hence it became evident that she needed to act and therefore she started a medical consultation for women that would happen at the school site and the school hours. And this was just the beginning of what would be the journey of her life over the next 30 years till 2002. 

</br></br>
The activities in the slums spread to other parts of Delhi and eventually she had created 7 schools taking care of 700 children in different slums. In parallel she continued to bring medical help to leprosy patients in Shadipur and at night on a footpath near the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, where a permanent group would be allowed to gather after 23.00. It was difficult to bring real medical facilities in these conditions and therefore she had been looking for a land to build a real hospital. After an extensive search, she eventually found a land in 1993 in Rishikesh where the Mateshwari Hospital was built. Several groups of leprosy patients were treated and reinserted into society by teaching them jobs like gardening and cloth spinning. As one of the schools the Sangita Vidhya Mandir (SVM) school was created in 1995 in the slum of ITO area of New Delhi. This slum running over several kilometres under water supply pipes and on the bank of the river Yamuna counted several hundreds of people living there. The school was started with 5 teachers and 6 classes and counted 80 children the day it opened. In 1997 she created the Shanti Delhi.
</br></br>
As these activities grew Sophie needed more resources to support them. She would get help from friends and build support by regularly sharing about her work on gatherings and small conferences organised for her in France and Belgium. It was in a first conference that was organised for her in Le Locle area of Switzerland that she met with Mrs Anita Bula. Anita immediately felt a deep connection with Sophie and her work, and she immediately decided to support her.  She created Shanti Delhi an association in Switzerland in 1997 to support Sophie’s work through personal donors and sale of Indian handicrafts at fairs. Shanti Delhi approach Swiss Air and in 1999 The Swiss Air Foundation for Children in Need started to support the school with an annual sponsor that has been continuing till this date. 
</br></br>
With the growing support and the need on the ground it was decided in 2000 to add new classes so that the students could at least reach up to the high school examination, which would allow them to get a basic job or obtain a small government loan helping them start a basic earning activity. In 2006 the slums of ITO were demolished as Delhi prepared to receive the Commonwealth Games and the government decided to relocate the slums to the outskirts of Delhi. The population however decided to stay on footpaths or small rented rooms around. We decided to continue the school and rented a small building in the nearby Ramesh Park area. The school would also offer a hostel facility for those children who didn’t have their parents or who couldn’t find an accommodation. It is also in this year that Shanti Delhi becomes Jivan Association Caritative. 
</br></br>
In 2009 our first batch of students reach the intermediary exam and some of them enter the University of Delhi. Students who didn’t go to university were also given opportunity to get training in drywall installation and create their company thanks to a partnership with Lafarge in India that was then establishing its gypsum business in the country. The first partnership firms were created in 2010 and are in activity till date. 
</br></br>
In 2015 SVM celebrated its 20 years of existence and 1000 students had been through the school since its creation. Many of them could secure better opportunities offering a better life for them and their families. 
</br></br>
Till date 1025 students have been through the SVM education program, 225 are currently enrolled and more than 150 reached university over all these years and could get into jobs such as engineering, medicine, accountant, technical skilled work and even music. As over the years the slum which was razed down in 2006 started to resettle we also felt we needed to go back closer to the children living there and hence in 2017 we decided to start a new morning and evening class in the slum.
